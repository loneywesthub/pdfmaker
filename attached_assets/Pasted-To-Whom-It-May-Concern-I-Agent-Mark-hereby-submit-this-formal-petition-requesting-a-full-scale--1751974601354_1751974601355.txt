To Whom It May Concern,

I, Agent Mark, hereby submit this formal petition requesting a full-scale investigation and legal action against Mrs. Jeanette Gomez, and her fiancé, Mr. Kevin Olszewski, for their involvement in multiple alleged financial violations, fraudulent activities, and breach of agreement.

1. Breach of Agreement and Failure to Repay Debt

Earlier this year, Mrs. Jeanette and I reached a clear financial agreement that she would repay me in monthly installments not less than $700 per month. She has failed to comply with this agreement and continues to avoid repayment. To date, I have not received consistent or adequate payments, despite numerous communications and reminders. This ongoing failure suggests willful deceit and financial irresponsibility. I request full restitution of the total owed amount through legal enforcement.

2. Illegal Transfer of Funds Outside the United States

Mrs. Jeanette has also been involved in transferring substantial sums of money internationally without following proper legal channels or fulfilling required tax obligations. These unauthorized transfers may constitute tax evasion, money laundering, and violation of U.S. federal financial laws. I respectfully request that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) open a formal investigation into her financial activities.

3. Assisting Criminal Scammers

Evidence in my possession shows that Mrs. Jeanette has knowingly sent funds to individuals and online scam networks who have targeted and defrauded both African and American citizens. Her role in facilitating these transactions raises serious concerns about criminal collaboration and aiding fraudulent enterprises operating across borders. I urge federal and international law enforcement agencies, including the FBI Cyber Division and Interpol, to investigate these connections without delay.

⸻

Request for Immediate Action

In light of the serious nature of these allegations, I am calling for:
	•	A full investigation into the financial dealings of Mrs. Jeanette and her fiancé Kevin;
	•	Enforcement of the repayment agreement through legal means;
	•	Forensic accounting of all international transfers made by Mrs. Jeanette;
	•	Legal consequences for any role played in supporting or enabling scam operations.

I am prepared to provide documented evidence and further testimony upon request. The misconduct outlined here not only affects me personally but also represents a broader threat to public trust and national security.

Sincerely,
Agent Mark
